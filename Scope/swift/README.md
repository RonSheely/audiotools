 * Resolution 0.022ms @ 44100 samples/sec
 * Single shot
 * Adjustable sync level
 * Storage
 * Cursor

## Using

Use the toolbar buttons to access functionality. From left to right:
bright line turns off sync, single shot, trigger, timebase menu,
storage mode, display clear, shift left, shift right, shift to start,
shift to end, reset. Clicking on the left y scale turns on the sync
level control, which may be shifted up and down using the up and down
arrow keys. Clicking on the scope display turns on the cursor line,
which may be shifted left and right using the left and right arrow
keys. The cursor line shows the time from the start of the trace in
current timebase units, and the nominal trace value at that
point. There is no calibration because of the various level controls
in the audio system. The shift to start and reset toolbar buttons
clear the sync level and the cursor.
